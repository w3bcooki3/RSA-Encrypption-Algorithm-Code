# RSA Algorithm

This is a Python implementation of the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithm, which is an asymmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure communication.

## Description

The RSA algorithm is based on the mathematical properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic. It involves key generation, encryption, and decryption processes.

The provided code performs the following operations:

- **Miller-Rabin Primality Test**: A probabilistic primality test used to check whether a number is prime.
- **Random Prime Number Generation**: Generates random prime numbers required for key generation.
- **Euclidean Algorithm**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
- **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: Finds the modular inverse of a number.
- **Square and Multiply Algorithm**: Efficiently computes modular exponentiation.
- **Key Generation**: Generates the public and private keys required for encryption and decryption.
- **Encryption**: Encrypts a given input message using the public key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts a given ciphertext using the private key.

## Getting Started

To run the code, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/w3bcooki3/RSA-Encrypption-Algorithm-Code.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd rsa

3. Run the script:

   ```shell
   python rsa.py

4. Usage
- Input a secret message when prompted.
- The code will generate the public and private keys.
- The secret message will be encrypted using the public key and displayed as ciphertext.
- The ciphertext will be decrypted using the private key and displayed as the original plaintext.
Note: The code includes sample prime numbers and is for educational purposes only. In real-world scenarios, large prime numbers should be used.
